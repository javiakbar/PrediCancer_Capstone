# PrediCancer_Capstone

Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. Advances in medical imaging and machine learning offer new methods for early diagnosis. This capstone project aims to develop a predictive model using the Breast Ultrasound Dataset, which classifies images as normal, benign, or malignant. The project will focus on data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support clinical decision-making. Successful completion could significantly improve medical diagnostics and patient outcomes for breast cancer.
